      "q2":"2. How Bexovid® works in our body?",
      "a2":"Bexovid® is a combination of Nirmatrelvir and a low dose of ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir disrupts the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the body by binding to the 3CL-like protease, an enzyme crucial to the virus’ function and reproduction. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of Nirmatrelvir, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of Nirmatrelvir.",
      "q3":"3. What is the indication of Bexovid®?",
      "a3":"Bexovid® is indicated for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 positive adult and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg), who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.",
      "q4":"4. What are the dosage & administration of Bexovid®?",
      "a4":"Bexovid consists of 2 medicines: nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.Take 2 tablets of nirmatrelvir with 1 tablet of ritonavir by mouth 2 times each day (in the morning and in the evening) for 5 days. For each dose, take all 3 tablets at the same time If you have kidney disease, talk to your healthcare provider. You may need a different dose",
